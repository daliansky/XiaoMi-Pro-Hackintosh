/*
 * Intel 300-series PMC support for macOS
 *
 * Starting from Z390 chipsets PMC (D31:F2) is only available through MMIO.
 * Since there is no standard device for PMC in ACPI, Apple introduced its
 * own naming "APP9876" to access this device from AppleIntelPCHPMC driver.
 * To avoid confusion we disable this device for all other operating systems,
 * as they normally use another non-standard device with "PNP0C02" HID and
 * "PCHRESV" UID.
 *
 * On certain implementations, including APTIO V, PMC initialisation is
 * required for NVRAM access. Otherwise it will freeze in SMM mode.
 * The reason for this is rather unclear. Note, that PMC and SPI are
 * located in separate memory regions and PCHRESV maps both, yet only
 * PMC region is used by AppleIntelPCHPMC:
 * 0xFE000000~0xFE00FFFF - PMC MBAR
 * 0xFE010000~0xFE010FFF - SPI BAR0
 * 0xFE020000~0xFE035FFF - SerialIo BAR in ACPI mode
 *
 * PMC device has nothing to do to LPC bus, but is added to its scope for
 * faster initialisation. If we add it to PCI0, where it normally exists,
 * it will start in the end of PCI configuration, which is too late for
 * NVRAM support.
